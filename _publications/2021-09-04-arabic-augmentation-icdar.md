### Abstract

Deep learning has significantly advanced the performance of classification and object detection tasks, but often requires large volumes of labeled data. This paper introduces a new **adaptive data augmentation algorithm** aimed at improving Arabic handwritten text recognition by increasing class diversity and balancing character frequency.

Each word in the lexicon is assigned a weight based on the occurrence probabilities of its characters, emphasizing minority classes. Our method demonstrates notable improvements on the **IFN/ENIT** and **AHDB** datasets, achieving **state-of-the-art performance**.

### Highlights

- Introduces a character-level class balancing technique for data augmentation.
- Emphasizes rare character classes via weighted augmentation strategy.
- Evaluated on two benchmark datasets: IFN/ENIT and AHDB.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for handwritten Arabic word recognition.
