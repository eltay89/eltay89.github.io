### Abstract

Recognition of cursive handwritten Arabic text is a complex task due to context-sensitive character shapes, variable spacing, and low inter-class variation. In this paper, we investigate and compare different deep learning architectures and modeling strategies for Arabic handwriting recognition. 

To tackle the challenge of data imbalance, we introduce a novel **adaptive data-augmentation algorithm** that assigns class-based weights to words in the lexicon. These weights are derived from the average class probabilities within each word. Our experiments on the IFN/ENIT and AHDB databases demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves **state-of-the-art performance**, outperforming traditional methods.

### Highlights

- Systematic review of deep learning methods for handwritten Arabic text recognition.
- Novel adaptive data-augmentation method to improve class diversity in training.
- Extensive evaluation on IFN/ENIT and AHDB datasets.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing systems.
