### Abstract

Training deep learning systems for handwritten Arabic text recognition requires large volumes of annotated data. Traditional data augmentation methods often fail to address imbalanced character distributions, which negatively impact recognition performance.

This paper presents a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**-based adaptive data augmentation technique specifically designed to counter character frequency imbalance in training datasets. The proposed method trains GANs on reweighted data distributions, encouraging balanced generation of minority characters. 

Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed adaptive GAN-based augmentation leads to **significant improvements in recognition accuracy**, outperforming conventional augmentation approaches.

### Highlights

- Introduces a GAN-based adaptive data augmentation method targeting character imbalance.
- Specifically tailored for handwritten Arabic text recognition tasks.
- Validated on two benchmark Arabic handwriting datasets.
- Outperforms standard augmentation in recognition accuracy and class balance.
