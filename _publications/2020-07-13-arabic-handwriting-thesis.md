### Abstract

Recognition of cursive handwritten Arabic text is a complex task due to context-sensitive character shapes, varying intra-word spacing, and minimal visual differences between certain characters. This thesis reviews and compares deep learning architectures suitable for Arabic handwriting recognition, emphasizing the challenges caused by imbalanced datasets.
