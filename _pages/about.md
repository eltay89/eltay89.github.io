Welcome to my website, built with Academic Pages and hosted on GitHub Pages.

I focus on machine learning, data analysis, and software development, using Python, TensorFlow, and Tableau. My projects include AI for Arabic handwriting recognition and privacy-safe document systems, plus publications in top journals. Check out my CV, blog, and publications for more.
