Welcome to my personal website, built using the Academic Pages template and hosted on GitHub Pages. This site showcases my work as a Computer Engineer and Data Analyst with a Master’s in Electrical Engineering.

I specialize in machine learning, data analysis, and software development, with expertise in Python, TensorFlow, and data visualization tools like Tableau. My projects include AI-driven solutions like Arabic handwriting recognition and privacy-first document processing systems, alongside publications in high-impact journals. Explore my CV, projects, and publications to learn more about my work.

This website is powered by structured Markdown files in a GitHub repository, automatically updating with each commit. It’s a simple, secure way to present my professional portfolio without ads or complex systems.
